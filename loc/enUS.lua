Usage: CurrentEquippedLevel()

Returns the current item level of the equipped item in the same slot, or 0 if the item being evaluated is not an equippable item or doesn't have a meaningful equipment slot.
This rule is for determining how an item compares to your currently equipped item in the same slot. For example, it can tell you
if the item being evaluated is an item level upgrade over the current item you have equipped in that slot.

For equipment that can be in multiple slots (such as rings) the number returned is the lower item level among the two items equipped.

For dual wielding characters, one-handed weapons will check both weapons.

For Fury warriors, two-handed weapons will check both weapons (to factor in Titan Grip).

## Examples

True if the item is equal to or higher item level than your current equipped item in that slot.

> CurrentEquippedLevel() <= Level

True if the item is within 13 item levels of your currently equipped ger (within one tier)

> CurrentEquippedLevel() <= (Level + 13)
